            <h4>Welcome to my portfolio! Glad you're here!</h4>
            <p>
              I'm currently residing in Seattle, WA which I have considered my
              home for the past two years. I was born and raised in California,
              but the urge for a new perspective had me itching to move. My love
              for coding developed later in life, but I'm more excited than ever
              to pursue a career in tech and to see where this journey will take
              me.
            </p>
            <h4>I consider myself someone who is both logical and creative.</h4>
            <p>
              I have a background in healthcare, namely Nursing. I was a
              Registered Nurse in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) where I cared
              for critically ill patients with life-threatening medical
              conditions. Being an ICU nurse really challenged my critical
              thinking skills by frequently assessing patient responses to
              medical treatments while following strict policies. It was an
              invaluable experience being at the bedside with patients and their
              families as they navigate through painful times in their lives.
              However, the lack of being creative within my career was missing
              and I wanted to seek out a field that nurtures both my logical and
              creative personalities.
            </p>
            <h4>My love for coding develops.</h4>
            <blockquote>
              “I think you’d be really good at coding” — A good friend
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              It wasn’t until I was told I’d be ‘good at coding’ that I even
              considered a career in tech. I also don’t see much of my
              demographic (Filipino-American) in tech roles. I tried
              <i>Flatiron School’s Free Coding Bootcamp Prep</i> and fell in
              love! I felt that this was the perfect blend of logic and
              creativity. I needed to learn more, so I signed up for their
              immersive Software Engineering course. 15 weeks later, I graduated
              and gained tech skills in Ruby on Rails, Javascript, SQL, React,
              and HTML/CSS.
            </p>
            <p>
              For my final capstone project, I created “Simple Care,” a medical
              care management tool to help caregivers organize their loved one's
              medications, conditions, appointments, and clinics. I felt it was
              the perfect blend of testing my new learned skills while bringing
              in my healthcare background in Nursing. I want to continue to
              build projects like these that showcase my past experiences and
              interests — healthcare, entertainment, dance, and nature.
            </p>
            <h4>Challenging myself to do more</h4>
            <p>
              As I continue to nurture my skills, I'm committed to learning more
              about programming. I maintain a technical blog so that I can keep
              up with the rapidly changing nature of technology and to help
              others along the wy. I also want to lead by example so that one
              day there would be more Filipino-Americans in tech. I am
              dedicating my time to sharpening my coding skills and inspiring
              those seeking a new career in tech to pursue their dreams.
            </p>
            <p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio!</p>
            <p>Take care,</p>
            <p>Andy del Valle</p>
